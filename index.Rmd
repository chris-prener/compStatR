The goal of `compstatr` is to provide a suite of tools for working with crime data made public by the City of St. Louis' [Metropolitan Police Department](http://www.slmpd.org).

## What's New?
### Latest GitHub
The current GitHub version contains a bug fix, not available on CRAN yet, that addresses a failure where the categorize and filter functions don't to work properly if the `var` column is not integer.

### Latest CRAN Release
Version v0.2.0 is here! This updated release of `compstatr` introduces three new functions that enable users to access data directly from SLMPD's website without having to download individual data files first:

  1. `cs_last_update()` - returns the date of the last available data release on SLMPD's website
  2. `cs_create_index()` - creates an index of data sets available on SLMPD's website for scraping
  3. `cs_get_data()` - scrapes either a single month or a full year worth of data from SLMPD's website

In order to enable them, there is one breaking change for users - all variable names are standardized into `snake_case` at import. This will impact code that has been written using a prior version of `compstatr`.

## Quick Start
If the `sf` package is already installed, the easiest way to get `compstatr` is to install it from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("compstatr")
```

The development version of `compstatr` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/compstatr")
```

Additional details, including some tips for installing `sf`, can be found in the [Get started article](articles/compstatr.html#installation).

## Resources
In addition to instructions for installation, the main [Get started](articles/compstatr.html) article has:

  * some tips on installing `compstatr` and its dependencies,
  * a quick overview of data acquisition,
  * an overview of the functions available in `compstatr`,
  * and a full example of the `compstatr` workflow along with some basic mapping of these data.

## Acknowledgements
We wish to thank Taylor Braswell for his significant efforts compiling Stata code early in this project. Taylor's code was used as a reference when developing this package, and many of the functions reflect issues that he worked to identify.
